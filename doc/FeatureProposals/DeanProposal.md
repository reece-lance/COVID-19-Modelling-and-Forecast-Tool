# Team Project Challenge: Possible New Ideas

## Actions by Local Government Timeline
- Include a tab that highlights and details the timeline of actions that have been taken by government, based on information provided by Wikipedia.
- Timeline can be scrolled through using mouse scroll or click and scroll or arrow buttons.
- Can also make use of JSoup. JSlider

## Vaccination Section from NHS website
- We could include data/timeline on vaccinations from the same NHS website
- Could also make use of current API or JSoup.

## Trending Countries (Country Comparison)
- Include minor data on other countries at first, but when a certain country is selected, a large data comparison between the UK and that country shows up.
- Emphasis on focus of UK and comparison with other varying countries.
- Could use Google for country data. Files containing country data would have to be updated as soon is application is run.

## Today’s News on COVID-19 (Google)
- We could include a news tab that retrieves all of the day’s news from a trustworthy site like Google.
- Could make use of either current API and libraries used for graph or use jsoup if permitted.

## Perfection of template Statistics within both the app and pdf
- We need to type out paragraphed templates that have changeable numerical data

## Retrieve more statistics
- Could get some statistics from website below (e.g Velocity and Reproduction Rate)
