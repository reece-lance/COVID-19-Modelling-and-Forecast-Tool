IDEA PROPOSAL

Moving average or Simple Moving Average (SMA)

When the program is used by a user, it lets you choose 3 different types of graphs, my idea is creating a new graph with the same data but showing the moving average of the COVID-19 cases.

This will show the average obtained from the data for some “t” period of time, (in this case 7 days ). In this case we will get the mean for some period “t” and then we will remove previous data. 

EXAMPLE:

You get the COVID-19 cases of 7 days (MONDAY – SUNDAY ), you calculate the mean from those 7 days and in the graph, it should show this mean as the start. The next step would be to remove the data from Monday and get the mean from (TUESDAY (of the same week ) – MONDAY next week) and so on.

HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT IN THE CODE 

This could be implemented by creating a new graph like it has been done with the others but adding the formula used to calculate the ( SMA )
