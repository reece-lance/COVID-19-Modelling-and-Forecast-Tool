# Feature proposals
## Feature 1
### Colour grading the map of the UK according to the case desnity.
- The colours will go from Red being the most dangerous to Green being the safest.
- It could be done by plotting the map of UK and then iterating over the attribute location, for eg if London has the highest cases being 1000 , it'll be assigned red. Basically, we could sort the number of cases according to the loactions and assign them colours. We could do this with the help of minigeo library.

- This feature will allow the user to see how risky is the location they're currently present in. 
 
## Feature 2
### Privacy FAQs tab/page for the users
- A simple tab like the 'export' tab named Priavcy FAQs, which will answer all the basic questions related to privacy as data usage is a big concern nowadays.
-  It could simply have a basic set of questions like
    - Why does the app need your name, location, etc?
    - What persoanl information does it collect?
- We could do this with the use of current API.
