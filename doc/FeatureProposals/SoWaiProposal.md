# show confidence intervals for piecewise regression in graph
## show upper and lower bounds of predicted piecewise line in the graph. for example two zigzag lines above and below the prediction line. 
## the lines can be drawn by calculating confidence interval (ie 95%) at every point. calculation in detail: https://rpubs.com/aaronsc32/regression-confidence-prediction-intervals
## the confidence interval can show the certainty of the prediction, smaller interval implies high certainty. 
## maybe there can be a button for user to choose to show the lines or not.
