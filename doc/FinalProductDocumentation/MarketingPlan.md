# Marketing Plan
# Customers

Our target market is any person, of any gender or age in the UK. The use of the product is not limited to certain social classes and a high-income level is not required. It can be used in education to spread awareness throughout schools. It can also be used in healthcare industries or just in day-to-day life. 

# Economics

The total size of our market is the majority of the UK population.

Our percentage share of the market will be around 25% as our main competitors have features using location services that we do not currently have, but a few of our main features are reasonably unique and are not featured in their products.

The current demand for Covid-19 related products containing statistics and useful data is very high due to the surge in cases over the past year, however it is expected to drop as soon as the infection rate hits zero, or when the virus is not considered a threat anymore.

One of the largest, most recent trends in healthcare apps in the past year is artificial intelligence such as using predictive modelling, which is used in our product to predict the infection rate of the virus.

Furthermore, in terms of Covid-19 trends, the focus is on contact tracing technology, with the government heavily pushing to "track and trace" in order to prevent the spread of the virus. The idea is that using location services, you can track a person's whereabouts and trace where you and others have been to alert the user if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive with the virus.

A program that fetches live data and calculates metrics and using a predictive algorithm, computes statistical graphs. It also provides the user with data from other countries around the world and compares the performance metrics. Another feature is a colour-coded, case-density, regional map.

# Place
Currently, the product can only be found on GitLab, however, our plan would be to convert the product to a web application. Also, in the future, we plan to convert the product to a mobile application to be located on the IOS App Store and Google Play Store.

# Sales Forecast
Our product could realistically achieve around 2000 sales as many applications include color-coded maps but do not allow the user to change the mapped variable. This is something which we allow the user to do which gives us that edge over our competitors.
