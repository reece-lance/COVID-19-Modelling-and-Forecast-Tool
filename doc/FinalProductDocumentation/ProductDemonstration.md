## Country Comparison Tab
Upon opening up the country comparison tab, you are presented with two 'unkown region' flags representing where the country flags will be, two drop downs on either side and a 'Refresh Data' button at the bottom.

![Comparison Tab](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/ComparisonTab1.png)

When the 'Refresh Data' button is pressed, all the country Covid data is represented in two seperate tables and the flags refresh to represent the country currently showing in the table below it. The two dropdown tabs initialise with the UK showing on the left side as the entire product is mainly focusing on data in the UK, but both dropdown options can be changed to show any other country in the world.

![After Refresh](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/ComparisonTab2.jpeg)

![Dropdown](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/ComparisonTab3.png)

Each of the country tables are separated into two sections by a very thin line. 

The upper section shows all the numerical figures while the lower section shows three different rates calculated from the data, as seen below.

![Table Splitting](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/ComparisonTab4.png)

The upper sections of each country table have black chevrons against every data count. A black up-arrow chevron shows that, for that particular data count, the number is higher than that of the compared country. The opposite is shown by the black down-arrow. In the event that the data count is the same for both countries, an equals sign is shown.

![Black Chevrons](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/ComparisonTab5.png)

The lower section of each country table has coloured chevrons. These chevrons are for the purpose of representing which rates are numerically higher/lower and whether that would impact the country positively/negatively in the fight agains coronavirus. An up-arrow chevron simply represents a higher numerical rate, as compared to a lower down-arrow chevron. In terms of colour, a red chevron represents that a rate impacts a country more negatively than it's comparison, while a green chevron shows that a rate has a more positive impact than it's comparison.

## PDFs

In the Graphs tab, there is a section in the bottom right containing tabbed panes:

![Graphs tab](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/1_front_page.png)

In this section at the top there is an Export tab you can select:

![Export tab](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/2_showing_tab.png)

The export tab has check boxes which allows the user to select which components they want to use in the PDF:

![Export page](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/3_tabbed_page.png)

![Check boxes](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/4_check_boxes.png)

There is also a check box in the Map tab located at the top of the page:

![Map tab](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/5_select_map_tab.png)

The check box is on the right hand side as shown in the image below:

![Map page](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/6_map_tabbed_page.png)

This allows the user to have the map that is in view to be in the PDF is the check box is selected:

![Map check box](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/7_map_check_box.png)

Once the user has chosen which components they want to include in the PDF, they can press the export button on the Export tab:

![Export button](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/8_export_button.png)

This brings up a pop-up file chooser allowing the user to choose a location on their file system to save the PDF file:

![Select directory](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/9_choose_directory.png)

Then the user can export the PDF file by pressing the save button:

![Save button](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/10_save_button.png)

The PDF file is then save in that location on the user's file system as shown in the image below:

![PDF in correct location](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/11_file_in_directory.png)

The image below is one example of the many possible outputs of the customisable PDF:

![Example PDF output](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/12_pdf_example.png)


## Maps

The map tab is located at the top of the main page as show below:

![Map tab](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/12_pdf_example.png)

![Map page](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/PDF/12_pdf_example.png)

This tab has many features including the interactive map, key, table, and map controls. The comboBozes located on the right hand side control what is shown in the map:

![Map controls](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/map_controls.png)

The first comboBox allows the user to select the map type, when clicked, the map content changes.

![Map type comboBox](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/map_type_comboBox.png)

The images below show what is displayed for each map type:

- Regions

![Regions](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Regions.png)

- UTLA

![UTLA](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/UTLA.png)

- LTLA

![LTLA](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/LTLA.png)

The second comboBox allows the user to select the map style, this changes the colours used in the map and the key.

![Map style comboBox](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/map_style_comboBox.png)

The image below shows one example (Style: Pheela) of the many style options the user has to customise the map:

![Pheela Style](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/LTLA_Pheela_Cases.png)

The final comboBox allows the user to select the mapped variable, the options are shown below:

![Map variable comboBox](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/map_variable_comboBox.png)

The image below shows one example (Variable: TotalDeaths) of the four variable options the user has the choice of to be mapped:

![DeathsTotal variable](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/LTLA_Pheela_DeathsTotal.png)

The key on the left of the page shows the user the value of the variable of each colour. This changes depending on the graph type, style and mapped variable.

![Map key](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/key.png)

The map has many interactive features as well as the customisable options already discussed.

### Map interactive features

- The user may zoom in and out of the map using the scroll-bar on their mouse or touchpad:

![Scroll to zoom](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Features/Scroll_to_zoom.png)

- The user can click and drag their mouse in order to pan around the map.

![Drag to pan](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Features/Drag_panning.png)

- The user can also click on any region and it will be highlighted in white as shown below:

![Select region](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Features/Click_on_region_white.png)

The final component of the map tab is the table which displays the data to the user based on the chosen map type. The rows in the table are sorted into ascending order based on the chosen map variable in the third comboBox on the right.

Example of LTLA table sorted by Cases

![LTLA table sorted by Cases](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Tables/LTLA_Cases.png)

Example of LTLA table sorted by DeathsTotal

![LTLA table sorted by DeathsTotal](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Tables/LTLA_DeathsTotalpng.png)

The final feature in the map tab in the link between the map and the table. When the user selects a region in the map, the corresponding row is selected in the table:

![Selects row when region is selected](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Features/Select_region_select_row.png)

Also, when the user selects a row in the map, the corresponding region is selected in the table:

![Selects region when row is selected](resourcesFinalProduct/ProductDemonstration/Map/Maps/Features/Select_row_select_region.png)

The user may also drag their mouse down each row through the table and the corresponding regions will be selected.
