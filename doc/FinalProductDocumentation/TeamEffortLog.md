### Sprint 4 (University Week 9-10)

- [Gluing together individual pieces of the whole team to create a MVP product](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-124) This task was set and completed in Sprint 4, and it took 39 hours and 30 minutes.

- I worked on integrating chromium browser with the help of a wrapper and combining the product for the MVP demonstration.
- Did investigation regarding piecewise linear regression, completed the algorithm in Java and got it peer reviewed by Dean and Nasar.

### Sprint 6 (University Week 17-18)

- [Feature proposals](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-195) This task was set and completed in Sprint 6, and it took 2 hours.

- I was a part of the meeting where we discussed possible features to be implemented into our program at a later date. i also put forward my ideas as a short presentation to the rest of the group. This contained a detailed explanation of my features and how they could easily be implemented to improve the product.

### Sprint 7 (University Week 19-20)

- [Trending Countries (Country Comparison)](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-186) This task was set and completed in Sprint 7, and it took 7 hours.

- I worked on getting the data from the api clients, data sources and cash handling capabilities for the different countries and helped with the design of the tab and it's final rendering visualisation.

### Sprint 8 (University Week 21)

- [Untangle git conflicts](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-254) This task was set and completed in Sprint 8, and it took 8 hours.

- I fixed all of the git conflicts. While I was at the git conflict resolution work, I did a massive refactor of our solution and finally implemented generic DataSource with CashHandler.

- [Colour-coded map implementation](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-248) This task was set and completed in Sprint 8, and it took 9 hours and 30 minutes.

- I retrieved the uk covid data for each region from the api and worked with Sanskar to plan the implementation of the map classes.

### Sprint 9 (University Week 22-23)

- [Country comparison - adaptation](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-290) This task was set and completed in Sprint 9, and it took 8 hours.

- I worked with Reece to improve the appearance of the trending countries tab by adding chevrons indicating performance and tool tips to improve UX. I also created renderers to give a nicer view of the data to the user.

- I also worked with Sanskar to show country flags next to the counrty names.

- [Colour-coded Map continued](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-277) This task was set and completed in Sprint 9, and it took 52 hours and 30 minutes.

- I have created a fully automated process for first extracting area codes out of the data that we have available.

- Second, using those codes for web scraping and requesting GeoJSONs, I then needed to create a script to appropriately scale the area of interest to the ratio of my wanted projection.

- When I had my rasterized data, I started to work on it's rendering. The map renderer can now plot basically any geojson and also differentiate different areas by colour for example.

- It also contains a set of keys for each area for their easy lookup. When you click on an area, it's key is retrieved.

- I came up with a file spec which also supports additional metadata about a given set of areas. That enabled me to load rasterized maps with much higher resolution than is that of my PC.

- I spent this time implementing features described in the demonstration section of the documentation. This included:

- colour scaling and 
- colour association
- colour themes
- gradient legend
- mapped to incoming data by area code
- clicking on map area to highlight table row
- clicking on table row to highlight map area
- switching between significant columns
- new significant columns
- map area selection indicator line
