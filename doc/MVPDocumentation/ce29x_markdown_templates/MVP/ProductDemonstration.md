## Export Tab
At the moment, when the export tab is selected from the top left of the screen, it displays an empty frame. What we intend to have here is a preview of what the pdf will look like before being exported as well as any extra PDF related features we may think of having in the future.

## Special Features
### PCLR
- The Piecewise Continuous Linear Regression is considerably one of the features we are most proud of. It took quite some time and effort to get it done.
### PDF Creation and Export
-  The PDF creation and exporting is also one of the features we are proud of. Although the created pdf does not yet contain everything we intend it to, we still consider the current stage to be pretty impressive.

## Possible Changes in the Future 
- We intend to include the UI element on the main form.
- We also think it would be interesting if the product were to become a cloud native web app.
- A feature allowing the user to select what information they would like to include in the PDF would also greatly improve our product.
