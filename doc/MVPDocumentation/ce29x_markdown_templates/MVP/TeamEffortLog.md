-  One of the few Jira issues that I needed to do for this sprint was a subtask to create a mySQL with schema.

- This work was used inside mySQL WorkBench to form a schema which helps to bring in the data form the government website and place it into the database. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/c7ecfaa78fab7d9da990bc16b2a152ec38e047df/src/database/covid_mft_db_creation
_script_V1.sql).

- The second Jira issue that was assigned to me was a subtask to create a file manipulation code. My group member and I was task to code a create, read, write and export Java code. Coding was done from both of us and we later on choose which is the most understable code.[Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/d85b2e6c846153f3e434505af3b2cf158c086427/src/File%20Manipulation/File%20manipulation%20eperiment/src/FileManipulation/CreateFile.java).

## Dean Makwarimba


### Sprint 1 (University Week 4):
* [Link to Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-17). It was  set and completed in Sprint 1. It took varied amounts of time and was not time based as it was merely brainstorming at this point. Everyone took part in the Initial Thoughts and hence it was unassigned.
* [Link to Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-2). It was set in Sprint 1 but completed in Sprint 2. Initially I had entered a mistake in the time it took, but I later corrected it to the 3 hours it actually took to complete. [Gitlab Link 1](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/a0887e5ebc5c5f774de797eded412a3b647a23c7/collaboration%20ver2.txt) 



### Sprint 2 (University Week 5 - 6):
* [Link to Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-25). It was set and completed in Sprint 2. It took 30 minutes to complete. [Gitlab Link 1](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/1bdf52a9132f17912e27ed1691d8bd34bb7d35d4/src/HelloWorldProject/src/csee/ce291_team02/Main.java)

[Gitlab Link 2](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/963ddeeb1e78dab75a91107101d652843db15027/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/csee/ce291_team02/Main.java). [Gitlab Link 3](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/2b06ba46e9ab247c9d2879f0e336744298e394ae/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/csee/ce291_team02/App.java).

*Coding for Task 1 was to familiarise with the use of IntelliJ with gitlab to ensure that we could all contribute coding in future.
Coding for Task 2 was for the creation of the JFrame application. I included 2 Gitlab links for this task. The first for the basic JFrame, the second for the overall initial UI of the application.*


### Sprint 3 (University Week 7 - 8):
* [Link to Task 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-101). It was set and completed in Sprint 3. It took 2 hours to complete.

* [Link to Task 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-78). It was set and completed in Sprint 3. It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to complete. Coding was done by Reece while I checked it.
* [Link to Task 3](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-79). It was set and completed in Sprint 3. It took 2 hours to complete. [Gitlab Link 2](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/1e2c0f65c080c2b92ca61d2194f3dc1c58132d63/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/target/maven-archiver/pom.properties).

*Coding for Task 1 was for creating a table which would have helped us in creating a graph within the application. We then found an easier method of doing so using a browser.
Coding for Task 3 was for the implementation of external libraries that would have helped us in the creation and exportation of PDF files. The libraries were iTextPDF and pdfBox. Only iTextPDF became instrumental in making our pdf.*

## Reece Lance

### Sprint 1 (University Week 4):

- [Familiarise with command-line cseegit:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-6) Set and completed in the first sprint within one hour and 30 minutes.
- This involved learning how to use the basic git commands in command-line/terminal. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/c7ecfaa78fab7d9da990bc16b2a152ec38e047df/collaboration%20ver2.txt)

### Sprint 2 (University Week 5-6):

- [Translate the user's proposal into formal User Stories:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-30) The sub-task was set and completed in the first sprint within one hour and 30 minutes.
- This task involved creating an initial plan based on how we interpretted the requirements and created stories in Jira corresponding to each part of the plan. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/10925781ad45fcbf7dd51b1893686fe9eb7b64a1/doc/jira_project_structure_and_units.md)
- Filip and I also planned the structure and story point units we would use within Jira. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/10925781ad45fcbf7dd51b1893686fe9eb7b64a1/doc/jira_project_structure_and_units.md)

- [Implementing wireframe of the Information System:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-20) The sub-tasks were created, assigned and completed in Sprint 2 and I logged 11 hours and 45 minutes.
- Dean and I created the JFrame using JSwing components. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/2b06ba46e9ab247c9d2879f0e336744298e394ae/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/csee/ce291_team02/App.java)
- We researched graphing libraries and chose to use JTableSaw to create our graph. This is also the data structure we used to create the table storing the graph data. We began research on how to show the data in graph form and imported the library through the Maven dependency but did not manage complete the table or graphing during this sprint as we were just receiving syntax errors in our code. We carried this task over to the next sprint. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/a057ed7d21b0f153217c529b871403604fdbe9c1/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/csee/ce291_team02/Graphs.java)

### Sprint 3 (University Week 7-8):

- [Implement the graphing:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-72) The sub-tasks were created and assigned in Sprint 3 and took 11 hours and 30 minutes in total to complete. These were all completed in Sprint 3.
- Working with Dean and Javier, we finally managed to create columns which we added into a table using JTableSaw. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/711a90d155baab312f30d5bb3d7561f1fb43c8b3/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/Graphs.java#L34)
- I then continued alone, working on the graph creation. After some research I figured out how to create the interactive graphs in a browser. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/0e7d5526de733352221abaae68fe6afad57a6dac/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/Graphs.java#L47)
- I experimented with JTableSaw some more and found out how to create a multi-plot (multiple graphs on a single chart). I also researched how to create HTML scripts generated through java and created a sample HTML file showing the interactive sample multi-plot. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/47ff7eac3d9d81197a5ce023cee10db98c123935/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/Graphs.java#L68)

- [Create a pdf export of the metrics and graphs:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-73) This story and its sub-tasks were created and completed during Sprint 3. I logged a total of 24 hours and 15 minutes.
- Dean and I researched PDF creation and found a library called iTextPDF. We implemented this library into our program and created sample code to create and write to a PDF. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/e9f1b3c2648ffcc1064be0839f86dcebe6d16390/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/PDF.java)
- After speaking to Filip, he infomed me that we would be better off working in xHTML as it would link to his work with showing the browser in the JPanel. I then began researching xHTML.
- We then researched a library called 'Moustache'. We created a sample xHTML document using 'Moustache' to input the graph data into the html script. [Permalink 1](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/56fbf41b3d9f32204bdc2091a9e9b1a36b417bb1/src/MustacheTemplatePrototype/src/main/java/Main.java) [Permalink 2](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/56fbf41b3d9f32204bdc2091a9e9b1a36b417bb1/src/MustacheTemplatePrototype/src/main/java/MVPTemplateModel.java)
- With guidance from Filip, I made adjustments to the PDF export code and to the sample xHTML script, tinkering each to accommodate for our data by creating a model for the table and its parts. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/92340df67457895a1019b737ae7f2006bd1b6e1e/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/PdfExport/templateModels/MVPTemplateModelBuilder.java)

- [Link to Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-5). This task completed at the end of week 4. It took an hour for me. 

- It is to familiarise to use the git command. Basically it's to learn how to commit my work to the Gitlab by command-line. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/54549992b95c15125198720b73a0dec341d6f7a1/collaboration%20ver2.txt).

### Sprint 2 (University Week 5-6):

- [Link to Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-43). This end at week 5 and it took 3 hours.

- Fillip and I discussed that piecewise linear regression is used for predicting short-term future, but not useful for prediction in long-term. This task is to analyse the data for interpretation and research on basic idea of piecewise linear regression. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/54549992b95c15125198720b73a0dec341d6f7a1/doc/InitialThoughtsOnDesign/InitialThoughtsOnDesign-SW.md).

- [Link to Task](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-105). This end at week 8 and it took 4 hours.

- Beside of showing graph and data, it is also necessary to let the users know the statistics of each piece of linear regression we applied on the data. Some very basic statistics was used like mean, range, correlation etc. In this task I tried to find out useful descriptive statistics and code to calculate those in Java.[Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/54549992b95c15125198720b73a0dec341d6f7a1/src/Metric/src/Metric.java).

## Filip Vlcek

### Sprint 1 (University Week 4):

- [Familiarise with command-line cseegit:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-6) Familiarizing myself with the GitLab environment, that was finished in 30 minutes.

This later resulted into the creating of a git FAQ document [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/c2f172b4ca4c793579c2a58f33f57c29679c91b3/doc/BranchingStrategyFAQ.md )

### Sprint 2 (University Week 5-6):

- [Extend our Java app to be able to import latest data:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-59) This issue was completed in three and a half hours.
- Problems solved: researching the government API, createing an API client in JAVA and preparing all of the serialized models.  [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/c2f172b4ca4c793579c2a58f33f57c29679c91b3/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/ukcovidapiclient/UkCovidApiClient.java)


- [Translate the user's proposal into formal User Stories:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-29) This took us two and a half hours.
- Me and Reece sat down to translate the requirements found on the moodle page into user-story issues with the initial subtasks included.
- I started nothing down a markdown document, which we later rewrote into jira [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/master/doc/translation-of-user-proposal-to-stories-v1.md)
- Another output of this effort was the set of basic rules of how to prevent our issue structure from colapsing [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/master/doc/translation-of-user-proposal-to-stories-v1.md)

- [Consultation - wireframe implementation](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-56) There was a whole series of consultation tasks as I wanted to make sure that I am there for the team whenever they were being blocked by a particular issue or just make their effort more effective by helping them with defining problem and planning a solution.
- I am quite proud of these as I have fullfilled my personal goal to help whenever I could.

### Sprint 3 (University Week 7-8):

- [Implement the linear regression in JAVA](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-65) I logged in 6 hours for this issue.
- Me and Sanskar sat down to implement a basic least squares linear regression algorithm prototype. 
- I then later worked on the actual integration with our graphing system, that was supported by what Reece did with my help regarding generating html files.

- [Research how do we include a browser to show our graphs:](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-89) This story took me three days, naively I thought that was extreme.
- I had to research suitable extensions to our applicaiton. I did succeed, I found an open source chromium wrapper for JAVA. This was scrucial as it would enable us to have beautiful interactive graphs and reuse those when generating pdf.
- I have ended up including the browser in a JPanel as a custom component. Going forward, we will need to build our own from source code if we want to fix some of the bugs we're having, like it not working on macOS. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/51ab59a202c76177ad7ca990ed09b855085f9c00/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/Forms/MainForm.java#L145)

- [Gluing together individual pieces of the whole team to create a MVP product](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291002-124) Is a story which was technically part of sprint 3, but I then took it out into sprint 4. I did start working on piecewise linear regression that sprint, I just had too optimistic time estimations. Ended up spending multiple days to finish it.
- It turns out I needed over three days in total to make all of the research for the technique choosen. Ended up implementing continuous piecewise regression. My team mates then helped me in proof reading as rewriting the equation I got to JAVA was extremely error prone. [Permalink](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce291/ce291_team02/-/blob/02944187a41a37c9f4118627aa1c4c619601a412/src/covid-mft-desktop-jv/src/main/java/csee/ce291_team02/stats/PclRegression.java#L188) This is the main meffor of the effort.
