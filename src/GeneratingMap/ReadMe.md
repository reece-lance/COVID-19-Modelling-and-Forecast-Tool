# How to
I suggest you create a new conda envornment for this map generator

- you have o install the environment dependencies using conda and conda_environment.yml
- you have to scrap the web by excecuting srcape_geoJsons.py
- you may wish to examine the settings.py to for example set the final resolution of the rasterized map
- you have to execute export_maps.py to generate the final maps as well as to update the maps in the covid-mft-java project
