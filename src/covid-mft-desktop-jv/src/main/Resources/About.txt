 -------------- The Product
    The main objectives of this COVID-19 modeling and forecasting tool are to retrieve live data and display it in a way that enables
    easier understanding and greater insights to current, past and future COVID-19 figures. To ensure the best of such understanding, various
    calculations, predictive algorithms and statistical graphs were constructed along with splendind methods that allow users to compare
    data regionally and internationally by making use of comparison tables and regional maps.

 -------------- The Team Behind The Product
    This product has been made possible by the efforts of a very talented team of Data Science and Analytics (BSc) students at The University of Essex.
    The project was tasked to the team as part of the Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Department module CE291 - Team Project Challenge.
